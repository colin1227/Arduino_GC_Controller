SIDE NOTE: I connected the collectors for both UP and Down to them middle pin on a rail of a breadboard same concept for the Left and right directions.

SIDE NOTE: the sticks are potentiometers so if you need slower speeds you will need to add a seperate transistor with a resistance of your choice between the base of the transistor and a pin comming from the Arduino.
